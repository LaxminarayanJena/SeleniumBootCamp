When a website is being migrated, it's crucial to test various aspects to ensure that the migration is successful, without data loss or functional issues. Below are some test cases you can consider during a website migration:

1. Pre-Migration Checks
Backup Data: Ensure a full backup of the website, database, and any associated assets before migration.
Current Website Comparison: Take note of the current website structure, URLs, SEO performance, and user experience to compare after migration.
2. Post-Migration Functional Testing
Content Verification: Verify that all content (text, images, videos, etc.) has been migrated correctly.
Test Case: Ensure content on all pages matches the old website.
Broken Links: Check for any broken internal or external links.
Test Case: Crawl the website using tools to identify any broken links post-migration.
Page Loading: Ensure that all pages load correctly without errors.
Test Case: Validate that no 404 or 500 errors are occurring after migration.
Forms and Interactions: Verify that all forms (contact forms, login forms, etc.) are functioning correctly.
Test Case: Submit forms and verify that they work as intended.
3. Design and Layout Testing
Visual Layout: Ensure that the migrated website maintains the same design and layout across all pages.
Test Case: Verify that the look and feel of the site are consistent across all devices and browsers.
Responsive Design: Test the website on different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure responsive behavior.
Test Case: Check page rendering on various screen sizes and orientations.
4. Database Testing
Data Integrity: Verify that the data from the old site (e.g., users, products, posts) has been migrated correctly without loss or corruption.
Test Case: Compare old and new databases, checking the total number of records for consistency.
Database Connectivity: Ensure the new site can correctly connect to the migrated database without issues.
Test Case: Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the migrated site.
5. URL Structure and Redirects
URL Integrity: Check that all URLs are correctly retained or redirected to the appropriate locations.
Test Case: Ensure old URLs redirect to new URLs correctly, especially for SEO purposes.
301 Redirects: Verify that appropriate 301 redirects are in place for any changed URLs.
Test Case: Test a sample of old URLs to ensure they redirect to the correct new locations.
6. SEO Checks
Meta Data: Ensure that meta titles, descriptions, and tags have been migrated correctly.
Test Case: Compare SEO metadata of the old and new site to ensure parity.
Sitemap: Ensure that a new sitemap is generated and submitted to search engines.
Test Case: Validate that the sitemap is updated and accessible from /sitemap.xml.
Robots.txt: Check that the robots.txt file is correctly configured post-migration.
Test Case: Verify that no important pages are accidentally blocked from being crawled.
7. Performance Testing
Page Load Speed: Test the speed of the new website and compare it with the old version.
Test Case: Use performance testing tools like Google Lighthouse or GTmetrix to measure page speed.
Caching: Verify that caching mechanisms are correctly configured on the new server.
Test Case: Test if server-side and client-side caching works as expected.
8. Security Testing
SSL Certificate: Ensure that SSL certificates are correctly installed on the migrated website.
Test Case: Check if the site is accessible via HTTPS and the certificate is valid.
User Authentication: Verify that all user accounts and permissions have been correctly migrated.
Test Case: Test login/logout functionalities and user roles.
Vulnerability Scan: Perform a vulnerability scan on the new site.
Test Case: Run automated security testing tools to check for vulnerabilities.
9. Analytics and Tracking
Tracking Codes: Ensure that Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, and other tracking codes are correctly implemented.
Test Case: Verify that tracking codes are firing correctly on key pages.
Event Tracking: Check if custom events or goals have been migrated correctly.
Test Case: Test specific event tracking (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) and goals.
10. Browser Compatibility Testing
Cross-browser Testing: Ensure the website works on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Test Case: Manually or using automation tools, test the site on different browsers for compatibility.
11. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
Client Review: Have end users or stakeholders review the website to ensure that it meets their expectations.
Test Case: Collect feedback from end-users to identify any issues or improvements.
12. Load and Stress Testing
Load Testing: Simulate multiple users accessing the website at once to ensure the site can handle the load.
Test Case: Use tools like JMeter to test concurrent users and measure server performance.
Stress Testing: Push the website beyond normal load to see how it behaves under extreme conditions.
Test Case: Test for how the website recovers from failures or high-traffic scenarios.
By covering these areas, you'll ensure the website migration is successful without sacrificing performance, security, or user experience.
