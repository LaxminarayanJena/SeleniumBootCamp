1) 4 liters of water using a 5-liter and a 3-liter jar:

Fill the 5-liter jar completely so it holds exactly 5 liters.

Pour water from the 5-liter jar into the 3-liter jar until the 3-liter jar is full. Now:

5-liter jar has 2 liters left.
3-liter jar is full with 3 liters.
Empty the 3-liter jar completely.

Pour the remaining 2 liters from the 5-liter jar into the 3-liter jar. Now:

5-liter jar is empty.
3-liter jar has 2 liters.
Fill the 5-liter jar again completely.

Pour water from the 5-liter jar into the 3-liter jar until the 3-liter jar is full (it currently has 2 liters, so it only needs 1 more liter to be full). Now:

5-liter jar has exactly 4 liters left.
3-liter jar is full with 3 liters.
Now you have exactly 4 liters of water in the 5-liter jar.
